### 1. Face Mask Detection using CNN  
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to classify whether a person is wearing a face mask or not.  

- **Dataset**: [Kaggle ‚Äì Face Mask Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset)  
- **Classes**: With Mask / Without Mask  
- **Methodology**:  
  - Images resized to **128√ó128** and normalized.  
  - CNN with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout layers.  
  - Optimizer: Adam, Loss: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy.  
- **Results**:  
  - **Test Accuracy**: ~94%  
  - High precision & recall for both classes.  
- **Applications**: Public health monitoring and compliance checking.

### 2. Breast Cancer Classification (Benign vs Malignant)  
A deep learning model to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant using numerical clinical features.  

- **Dataset**: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (UCI)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic)) (via scikit-learn).  
- **Features**: 30 attributes from cell nucleus measurements.  
- **Methodology**:  
  - Preprocessing with standard scaling.  
  - Dense neural network with hidden layers and ReLU activations.  
  - Evaluation with confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve.  
- **Results**:  
  - **Accuracy**: ~97%  
  - Strong precision and recall, especially for malignant detection.  
- **Applications**: Early cancer detection support (research purpose only).
